# Searchapp
New Search Application

This app will help you  make faster searches while you are not focused on your web browser.

For better use, bind the script to a keyboard shortcut.

## Usage

It's very simple to use, just type
* g github

and it will look for "github" on google.

Another example:
* y funny cats

will look for funny cats' videos on youtube.

### Default value

Now you can set a default value so that you don't have to write the key to the search that you most use.
To set the default value just type:

* !default g

In this case, this will make Google your default search.

To change it, just set the default value to whatever other key you have stored or just type 'none' to 
go back to having no default value.

* !default none

### Add new searches

The default search values are Google, Youtube and Wikipedia but you can add whatever search you like just
pasting the desire url in the "Add" menu.
The easiest way to do this would be to search for something in you desire website and then replace the search in the url with the tag <searchapp> before pasting it in the Add menu.

Example:

![alt tag](https://s31.postimg.org/p5m41otaz/Screenshot_from_2016_06_20_16_41_40.png)

Link before: amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=guitars

Link after: amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=\<searchapp\>

Here we would be adding Amazon to our searches, so next time we type:

* am notebooks

it will open a browser with that new search.

### Delete old searches

To delete a search you just need to go to the "Delete" menu and write the Name value of the search you don't want anymore.
It has to be the same value as you enter the time you added it. You can check for the name in the "List" menu.

Example:

![alt tag](https://s31.postimg.org/ew93fb623/Screenshot_from_2016_06_20_16_48_49.png)

This will delete Amazon search from the app.
